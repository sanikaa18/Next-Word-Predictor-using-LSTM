# Next-Word-Predictor-using-LSTM
Build a model to predict the next word in a given sequence of text.
Use LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies in the text data and added Dense layers for final word prediction.
Tools Used: Python, TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the LSTM model, NLP libraries for text preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, padding)
